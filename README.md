This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) with your browser to see the result.

It’s designed to serve as a clean, minimal starting point — perfect for anyone who wants to quickly launch a portfolio or personal site, and then freely **customize, extend, or modify** it to fit their own style and needs.
